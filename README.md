# Pixie

Pixie Game is a 2D RPG developed using the Love2D framework and Lua programming language. Drawing inspiration from classics like "The Legend of Zelda" and the charming farming simulator "Stardew Valley," Pixie Game embarks on a journey to capture the essence of adventure, exploration, and community building in a whimsical 2D world.
